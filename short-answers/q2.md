# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer

Any problem that can be solved with an iterative function can be solved with a recursive one, so you have to pick and choose which you'd need based on things like space and time requirements, though they are used to great effect with problems involving tree structures or multi-level structures. Anywhere where we might have nested data structures recursion can be super helpful!
